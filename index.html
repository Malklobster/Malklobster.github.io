    <h2>Whats it about</h2>
    <p>This is a website about LGBTQ genders and sexual prefrences. you can click on the words and they will pop up and tell you what they are. Behind the discriptions are the offical flags that represent the gender and/or sexuality.
     Some stuff about me:
     I love to code and learn new things and i am in the LGBTQ community and wanted to tell others about it. Lots of people are confused by what the diffrent genders and sexualites are so i gave them a kind of dictionary for it.
